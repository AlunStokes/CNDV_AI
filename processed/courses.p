S'The change process isn\'t simply about introducing new systems or introducing new job roles-it\'s about people and their transition from an old way of working to a new one. Change is a process, a problem, and a professional practice. Managers, consultants, psychologists, and analysts attempt to differentiate "making" change from "coping with" change. They stress the steps of change, the cycle of change, and the emergence of change.'
